This is specialized Django project intended to be used in the development of
individual Django apps outside of a larger project.

Intended to be used with virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper.

I put this up on GitHub as soon as I first got it working. It will be fixed up
and better documented soon.


Usage:

1. Add SAWHORSE_HOME to your environment (analogous to virtualenvwrapper's
WORKON_HOME). This is where Sawhorse will put development files for each app.
2. Install Sawhorse into an app's virtualenv with pip.
3. You may add a required_settings.py and/or a local_settings.py to your app
to override default settings from Sawhorse.
4. Run management commands with shmanage.py <command>.
5. That's it.


Why did I do this?

In my personal development workflow, I often finding myself creating an
"example project" with a new app in order to run the tests, run the development
server, etc, even if I am developing the app in a "standalone" fashion (my
preferred way to start a new app). Worse, because I want myself and others to
be able to run the app by itself from a clone of the repo, I usually end up
including this example project with the app. This seems messy and undesirable,
as the example project really has nothing to do with the functionality of the
app. Sawhorse, then, is intended to work as that "example project", but for any
app. This way, only a minimal amount of extra configuration needs to be
included with the app itself, but it's still very easy to get up-and-running
when developing or researching a new app.


Coming soon:

Better documentation, better support for different types of apps. Possibly
I will realize this whole thing is a bad idea and scrap it. Feedback welcome!
