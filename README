This is specialized Django project intended to be used in the development of
individual Django apps outside of a larger project.

In my personal development workflow, I often finding myself creating an
"example project" with a new app in order to run the tests, run the development
server, etc, even if I am developing the app in a "standalone" fashion (my
preferred way to start a new app). Worse, because I want myself and others to
be able to run the app by itself from a clone of the repo, I usually end up
including this example project with the app. This seems messy and undesirable,
as the example project really has nothing to do with the functionality of the
app. Sawhorse, then, is intended to work as that "example project", but for any
app. This way, only a minimal amount of extra configuration needs to be
included with the app itself, but it's still very easy to get up-and-running
when developing or researching a new app.
